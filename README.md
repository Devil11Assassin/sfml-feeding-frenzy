# Feeding Frenzy

Feeding Frenzy is a single-player mode and arcade-style aquatic video game written by Sprout Games, and published by PopCap Games on February 11, 2004. In Feeding Frenzy, players control a hungry marine predator intent on munching as many other fish as possible. The player takes on the role of different aquatic species each trying to move up the food chain.

In Q2 of 2023, The goal of this project was to apply the concepts of Structured Programming by cloning the game using the [SFML Library](https://github.com/SFML/SFML).

In Q3 of 2024, the goal was expanded to include the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures.
